## Events

### Lab meetings

This term (Winter 2026) the lab meets weekly on __Fridays__ at __13:30__ in
[LSB 216](https://goo.gl/maps/2FPGTZHVyQpgsCh47) 
_or_ in the
[private Zoom](https://mcmaster.zoom.us/j/98856294231).
For joint events, there is a
[public Zoom](https://mcmaster.zoom.us/j/97351841357).

The private and public rooms both require a password.
[Send JD an e-mail](mailto:dushoff@mcmaster.ca) if you can't find it.
Feel free to share the password for the _public_ room with colleagues 
outside of the lab. If you need to "claim host" (e.g. to record a meeting),
the host key is **551825**.

Please spend about 42.5 minutes preparing for each lab meeting by:

* Finding the meeting topic in the meeting schedule spreadsheet;
  see _Quick links_ above.
* Doing the linked reading (if we are discussing a paper) or
  installing required software (if we are discussing software).
* Thinking about what you want to ask or say.
* Thinking about possible topics for future lab meetings.

We _plan_ lab meetings using the lab [Zulip server](https://mac-theobio.zulipchat.com/).
Use the "Meeting topics" channel to discuss topics and the "lab" channel
(as well as the schedule spreadsheet) to record decisions.

### Lab coffee

On __Friday__ at __14:30__, people meet in
[LSB 216](https://goo.gl/maps/2FPGTZHVyQpgsCh47) then go somewhere
for coffee and chatter.

## Accessing PDF versions of papers

You can use Mac credentials to access library resources off campus.
Try appending `.libaccess.lib.mcmaster.ca` to the domain part of a 
URL.  For example:

<https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27856216/>  
<https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.libaccess.lib.mcmaster.ca/27856216/>

The latter should ask you to log in, and once you do so you should 
have access to the PDF.  It is sometimes better to append to the
URL where you actually see the paywall.  For example:

<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022519316303629>  
<https://www.sciencedirect.com.libaccess.lib.mcmaster.ca/science/article/abs/pii/S0022519316303629>

It may help to visit the new URL a second time after logging in.
