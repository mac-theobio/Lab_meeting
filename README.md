# Mac-Theobio Lab Meetings

- Tuesdays at 1:30PM (Toronto time)
- LSB-216 or [Google hangout](http://tinyurl.com/theobio-lab-meeting)
* Please spend about 40 minutes preparing for each lab meeting (including the reading and preparing what you do or don't want to say)

## Upcoming Meetings

- 31 Oct: [A primer on stable parameter estimation and forecasting in epidemiology by a problem-oriented regularized least squares algorithm](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468042717300088)

## Proposed Readings and meeting topics

- [Guardian article on scientific publishing, Elsevier etc.](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science?CMP=share_btn_tw)
- [The PTRSB Theme issue on ecology and evolution of parasite transmission](http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/372/1719)

- [Lotka-Volterra pairwise modeling fails to capture diverse pairwise microbial interactions](https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e25051)

- [Leaf bacterial diversity mediates plant diversity and
ecosystem function relationships](https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v546/n7656/pdf/nature22399.pdf)

- multiple comparisons and false discovery rates, e.g. [here](http://www.biostathandbook.com/multiplecomparisons.html) (basic but not silly)
	* Nobody owns this, so we might not do it.

## Suggested additional agenda Items

## Past readings and agenda items

- 24 October: informal chat (no notes taken, apparently)

- 17 October: Daniel P. will present his research on estimating the effects of paraistes on the maintenance of sex. The Red Queen Hypothesis predicts that sexual reproduction can overcome the two fold cost of sex under parasite selection by creating rare genotypes that can escape infection. Lively ([2001](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278886730_Trematode_infection_and_the_distribution_and_dynamics_of_parthenogenetic_snail_populations)) predicted that prevalence of infection should be positively correlated with prevalence of sex. Here, we try to estimate the power to detect the correlation and discuss limitations of spatial data.

- 10 October: David C. will present a statistical method he designed. A meta-analysis aims at infering a pooled estimate of an effect size reported by various studies, taking into account the size and uncertainty of each study. The classical statistical toolbox of meta-analysis assumes that all studies report the mean and variance of the effect size. However, when studies reports partial and heterogeneous type of summary statistics, the classical toolbox is not applicable anymore. The method presented here addresses this gap.

- 2 October. Discussing Morgan and Ben's draft paper about pathogen evolution and host heterogeneity (sent by email)
