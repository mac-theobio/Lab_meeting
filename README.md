## Suggested additional agenda Items

## Past meetings

* [archive](archive.md)

### 2023 Jan 26

Some thing (things) from this list: Chen *et al*. is a recent review of use of FDEs in epidemic models, but really doesn't say much at all about interpretation. Podlubny is weird; maybe interesting but not, I think, useful. My guess is that Du *et al.* might be the best choice.

* Chen, Yuli, Fawang Liu, Qiang Yu, and Tianzeng Li. “Review of Fractional Epidemic Models.” Applied Mathematical Modelling 97 (September 2021): 281–307. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apm.2021.03.044 .
* Du, Maolin, Zaihua Wang, and Haiyan Hu. “Measuring Memory with the Order of Fractional Derivative.” Scientific Reports 3, no. 1 (December 5, 2013): 3431. https://doi.org/10.1038/srep03431 .
* Podlubny, Igor. “Geometric and Physical Interpretation of Fractional Integration and Fractional Differentiation.” arXiv, October 22, 2001. http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0110241 .

This also looks useful as a very basic intro/start to getting some intuition:
