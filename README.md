 	* [Twitter summary](https://twitter.com/RJOidtman/status/1367148784019365889)
	* Irena will lead:
		* This looks like a really nice "lessons learned" paper about modeling an emergent infectious disease, and it's not COVID! The case study is actually Zika virus, which means there's more hindsight to learn from. 
		* The preprint is hot off the press (posted 1 March), but from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RJOidtman/status/1367148784019365889), it sounds like it's already been reviewed. I wonder if the preprint was only posted recently because it's been accepted by a high tier journal...
