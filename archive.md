### 29 May. Heterogeneity and herd immunity

This topic was triggered by [this twitter thread](https://twitter.com/bansallab/status/1258872610210877442) (scroll up for main thread). There are at least three interesting-looking pubs cited here (Gomes, Britton, Bansal). Gomes is the main reading for this week, so spend some time on that and move on to the others if you have time and interes.

Please also add notes or resources about this topic!

- Feb 28: Read from the [GUSTA ME](https://sites.google.com/site/mb3gustame/constrained-analyses/rda) website for 45 minutes, focusing on:
	- Dissimilarity based methods
	- constrained analyses
	- indirect gradient analysis
	
	- Some other resources:
		- Learn the basics of PCoA. Can anyone suggest a reading?
			- This isn't a full solution: it doesn't help with the inference/why we would do one or the other, but it does explain the geometry pretty nicely ... [PCA and PCoA explained](http://occamstypewriter.org/boboh/2012/01/17/pca_and_pcoa_explained/), from Bob Carpenter
		- Mike suggests we cover all the variants: (PCA, PCoA, CPC (common principal components), Factor analysis, CVA (canonical variate analysis), Non-negative matrix factorization) (the [CANOCO](http://www.canoco5.com/index.php/canoco5-overview) web page lists: DCA, CA, CCA, DCCA, PCA, and RDA ...)
		- There's also [NMDS](https://jonlefcheck.net/2012/10/24/nmds-tutorial-in-r/), which is very popular among microbiome people. (JCSz) That link says something I don't understand about NMDS: 
			- "NMDS requires a distance matrix, or a matrix of dissimilarities. Raw Euclidean distances are not ideal for this purpose: they’re sensitive to total abundances, so may treat sites with a similar number of species as more similar, even though the identities of the species are different." This shouldn't be true, should it? If each species gets its own axis...
