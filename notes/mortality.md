A recent paper (from Brazil) suggested that around 1 in 500 people could die from an uncontrolled covid epidemic. This is 20 per 10,000. For comparison, seasonal influenza kills around 2 people per 10,000 each year; total crude death rates per year are around 80 per 10,000; the 1918 flu pandemic killed about 220 per 10,000.
