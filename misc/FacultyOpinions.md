# Faculty Opinions

As noted in today's (1 June 2023) lab meeting, I am a member of what used to be called "Faculty of 1000" and is now called "Faculty Opinions". See https://facultyopinions.com/. Postdocs and grad students (maybe undergrads too, I forget) can be made associate members. The reason you would do this is that you can then write reviews of papers and have them appear on Faculty Opinions. These aren't refereed publications, but they can be listed on your CV as publications, and writing such reviews (which can be just a few lines) might forced you to think more carefully about papers you read. If you'd like to be an associated member, let me know: earn@math.mcmaster.ca
