## Python equivalent of R Shiny

  ---- full.csv (cleaned data: theme count group by day) 
  ---- monthly.csv (cleaned data: theme count group by month)


main.py
	- run `python3.8 main.py` in command line 
	- will pop up a local host link and open in browser 
	- (has a bug that shows error but when you start dragging the month slider the graph will show up)
