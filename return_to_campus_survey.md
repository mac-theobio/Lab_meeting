## Other possible questions, options, issues

- Add an option to say if they live in a multigenerational household.
- Maybe ask if any person in their household is an essential worker.
- how many people in your household have received the vaccine?
- Effects of social networks/media: To what extent are your answers influenced by friends/family/media? [Likert scale]
- Perhaps ask for month ratherÂ than approx date if they can't remember when they had COVID, a test or the vaccine.
- For the 'Have you had COVID' question, it might be helpful to give
people some guidance about what mild vs. severe illness are, whether
to consider long-covid symptoms, etc.
- Do you want to give respondents the option to self-identify as
members of any marginalized groups? This could provide useful info on
who would be most affected by which decisions. Some things to ask
about might be: members of racialized groups, being at high risk
medically from COVID, having a disability.

_For questions aimed at students:_
- I didn't see any questions about what safety precautions people
might like to see taken during in-person classes (e.g. requiring
masks, limiting class sizes, opening windows, etc.). Are these topics
you might want respondents' feedback about?
- What accommodations do students feel they need to ensure that they
are able to stay home from class if they are exposed to COVID or feel
unwell without worrying about falling two weeks behind in their
courses?

_For questions aimed at staff, maybe consider:_
- asking people if they feel like they have adequate access to sick
leave or remote work options so that they can stay home if they are
exposed to COVID or are having even mild cold symptoms?
- asking people if they believe some or all of their job could still
be done remotely, and if they would rather return to campus or stay
home? Some options here could include things like "want to return if
I'm fully vaccinated/want to return if my whole office is
vaccinated/want to return if community transmission is below X/prefer
working from home and would like to keep doing so indefinitely"

_For questions aimed at faculty:_
- What safety precautions would faculty like to see taken during in-person
classes (as above for students)?
- Are faculty adequately supported in making sure students (whether
students in classes or grad students they are supervising) can stay
home if they are exposed to COVID or feel ill?
- Are faculty adequately supported to be able to shift to online
instruction if they are exposed to COVID or feel ill?
- Would faculty prefer to teach online or in person in the fall, and
under what circumstances?

- The survey isn't actually asking whether the respondent thinks an
institution-wide return to in-person work/instruction is a good
idea. Without this question, it gives the impression that that
decision is a fait accompli. Is that something you want community
feedback on? Or are there other metrics that the decision is being
based on?
