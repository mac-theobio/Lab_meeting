# potential survey questions

(IP: General comment about demographic questions... Clarify when you're asking about people's present circumstances and when you're asking them to answer based on hypotheticals, like returning to campus (e.g. in the case of the the household question). Throughout the survey, it's important to be clear about the scenario students should keep in mind when answering each set of questions.)

- Basic demographic info (have "prefer not to say" as an option)
	- gender [F/M/non-binary/agender/genderqueer/other], age, role at Mac [student/staff/faculty/other]
	  - if student: undergrad/grad? home faculty? year in program?
	- Do you live on campus?
	- If not, how will you get to campus (check all that apply)? [live on campus, walk, bike, public transit, car pool, private vehicle]
	- how many people live in your household (including you)
      [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10+] 
	- what type of household is it?
      [family home / student house / apartment / university residence / other]
- Have you ever had a COVID-19 test?
	- How many times?  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5-9, 10-19, 20+]
	- If yes, when was the most recent?
	- If more than one time, when was the first? 
	- If yes, why did you have your most recent test? [had symptoms / contacted someone with covid / covid alert app told me I'd been near someone who tested positive / travel / other:specify]
- Have you had COVID-19?
	- When? (approximate date if you don't remember exactly when)
	- Was it confirmed by a test?
	- How severe was your illness?  [asymptomatic, mild, severe, hospitalized]
- Have you been vaccinated for COVID-19?
- if YES:
	- When? (approximate date if you don't remember exactly when)
	  - answer separately for dose 1 and dose 2
	- Which vaccine did you get?  [AZ, Pfizer, Moderna, J&J, Sputnik]
- if NO:
	- Do you plan to be vaccinated when it is offered to you?
	- if YES:
		- will you take any vaccine you are offered?
			- if not, which vaccine(s) are you NOT willing to take? (or
              rank your preferences, with ability to say "will not take")
	- if NO:
		- why not? [vaccine safety / allergies / other: specify]
- Are you willing to attend in-person classes if some people in the
  class are not vaccinated? [Yes, Yes for small classes only, No, Not Sure]
- Which on-campus facilities do you think you would use in the Fall if they are open? [gym, libraries, student centre,
food courts / restaurants, coffee shops / bars]
- Are you willing to fill in surveys like this once every two weeks
  to help monitor the situation in the McMaster community?
  _Must do this via non-identifying survey token_
- Any comments/concerns/suggestions?  [free text box]
	[[About what? If you're interested in feedback, consider giving more guidance than this]]

## Other possible questions, options, issues

- Add an option to say if they live in a multigenerational household.
- Maybe ask if any person in their household, or the student themselves, is an essential worker, or would be while coming to campus for the Fall term.
- how many people in your household have received the vaccine?
- Effects of social networks/media: To what extent are your answers influenced by friends/family/media? [Likert scale]
- Perhaps ask for month ratherÂ than approx date if they can't remember when they had COVID, a test or the vaccine.
- For the 'Have you had COVID' question, it might be helpful to give
people some guidance about what mild vs. severe illness are, whether
to consider long-covid symptoms, etc.
- Do you want to give respondents the option to self-identify as
members of any marginalized groups? This could provide useful info on
who would be most affected by which decisions. Some things to ask
about might be: members of racialized groups, being at high risk
medically from COVID, having a disability.
- The survey isn't actually asking whether the respondent thinks an
institution-wide return to in-person work/instruction is a good
idea. Without this question, it gives the impression that that
decision is a fait accompli. Is that something you want community
feedback on? Or are there other metrics that the decision is being
based on? (<- IP: I agree with this, and I'll add that I think it's important to be very clear what the reopening scenario is in the background when you ask questions about an individual's prospective behaviour. What is the school considering? It might actually be useful to describe the scenarios under consideration, like partial reopen, full reopen, and repreat some questions for each scenario to see how people's behaviours might change in each case. For instance, if classes are even partially online, some people may choose to stay at home, potentially outside of the Hamilton area, but without an online option they might return to campus.)
- IP: Cornell asked a bunch of questions about academic calendar preferences; they were considering a few version that would minimize/discourage out-of-town travel (e.g. skipping breaks in the middle of the semester to shorten the overall term, making short breaks mid-week to make it harder to travel far away). Ithaca is pretty geographically isolated, while McMaster is not, so I think there need to be a few questions aimed at travel/commuter behaviour under each reopening scenario.

_For questions aimed at students:_
- I didn't see any questions about what safety precautions people
might like to see taken during in-person classes (e.g. requiring
masks, limiting class sizes, opening windows, etc.). Are these topics
you might want respondents' feedback about? (<- IP: on this note, it might be useful to ask about people's adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions relative to their vaccination status, current incidence of case reports, etc.)
- What accommodations do students feel they need to ensure that they
are able to stay home from class if they are exposed to COVID or feel
unwell without worrying about falling two weeks behind in their
courses?

_For questions aimed at staff, maybe consider:_
- asking people if they feel like they have adequate access to sick
leave or remote work options so that they can stay home if they are
exposed to COVID or are having even mild cold symptoms?
- asking people if they believe some or all of their job could still
be done remotely, and if they would rather return to campus or stay
home? Some options here could include things like "want to return if
I'm fully vaccinated/want to return if my whole office is
vaccinated/want to return if community transmission is below X/prefer
working from home and would like to keep doing so indefinitely"

_For questions aimed at faculty:_
- What safety precautions would faculty like to see taken during in-person
classes (as above for students)?
- Are faculty adequately supported in making sure students (whether
students in classes or grad students they are supervising) can stay
home if they are exposed to COVID or feel ill?
- Are faculty adequately supported to be able to shift to online
instruction if they are exposed to COVID or feel ill?
- Would faculty prefer to teach online or in person in the fall, and
under what circumstances?

_Other resources:_
- IP: Cornell sought a bunch of public feedback in Spring 2020 about reopening in Fall 2020, in the form of several town halls and a formal survey. I've emailed a person who conducted the survey to ask for a copy of the questions (and will forward if I get them), but you can at least get a sense of what they were asking about in Appendix 3 [here](https://covid.cornell.edu/_assets/files/ctro-final-report.pdf) (starting on pdf page 58), as well as the kinds of concerns students expressed at the time.
